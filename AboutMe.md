## Greetings! 

My name is Christian Stevens, a former Project Manager who completed programs at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas (Cybersecurity Bootcamp) and Harness Projects (Cybersecurity Career Launcher). I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in network security, threat analysis, and incident response. Proficient in leveraging various cybersecurity tools and technologies to identify vulnerabilities and protect against cyber threats. I bring a proven history of successfully managing high-profile projects and excelling in fast-paced, high-pressure environments. With exceptional problem-solving skills, keen attention to detail, and the ability to work independently and collaboratively, I am well-equipped to tackle complex challenges in the cybersecurity field.

Recently, I completed eight comprehensive courses at UNLV: Social Engineering & Ethical Hacking, Designing Your Cybersecurity Network, Digital Forensics & Incident Reporting, Integrating Your Infrastructure Security, Microsoft Security System & Administration, Computer Networking Fundamentals, Securing Your Network, and Threat Hunting and Intelligence.  

While taking these eight courses, I have also completed real-life projects with Harness Projects: Web Vulnerabilities Assessment, Infrastructure Vulnerabilities Assessment, Security Risk & Policies Assessment, and Incident Response Containment & Recovery.
